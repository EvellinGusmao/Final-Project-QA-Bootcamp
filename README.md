#### Final Project of the Quality Assurance Bootcamp - API Urban.scooter
The goal of this project was to analise and test the back-end requirements and documentation of the Urban.scooter API.
The API was tested and a checklist was created with the test results and bug reports. 

Postman was used to test the API according to the requirements, using JSON.
The Jira software was used to register each bug, documentating screenshots, expected outcomes, real results, process and environment.
Drawio was used to create the Mental Map for the "Order Form", making it much easier to identify the Interface and functionality requirements and process.
All was documentated on Excel Spreadsheets to better visualize the entire project.

The Urban.scooter is a very useful and practical API, nevertheless, some adjustments can be done to better itÂ´s quality and consequently, the users experience.
