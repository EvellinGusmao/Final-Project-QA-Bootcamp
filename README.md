### Final Project: Quality Assurance Bootcamp - Urban.Scooter Application and APIs
The objective of this project was to thoroughly analyze and test the back-end requirements and documentation for the Urban.Scooter Application and its APIs. 

#### Tools and Process:
- Postman: Used for comprehensive API testing, ensuring compliance with requirements through JSON-based validation.
- Jira: Employed for meticulous bug tracking, with each issue documented, including screenshots, expected vs. actual outcomes, steps taken, and environmental details.
- Draw.io: Utilized to create a mental map of the Order Form, simplifying the identification of interface and functionality requirements.
- Excel: All project documentation, including test results and bug reports, was organized and recorded in Excel spreadsheets.

Extensive testing was conducted, leading to the creation of a detailed checklist that captured the results and identified bugs.

#### Outcome and Recommendations:
The Urban.Scooter application and APIs are practical and user-friendly. However, some improvements are recommended to enhance the overall quality and user experience.
