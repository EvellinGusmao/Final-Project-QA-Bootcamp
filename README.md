#### Final Project of the Quality Assurance Bootcamp - Urban.Scooter Application and API´s
The goal of this project was to analise and test the back-end requirements and documentation of the Urban.Scooter Application and API´s.
The application and API´s were tested and a checklist was created with the results and bug reports. 

Postman was used to test the API according to the requirements, using JSON.
The Jira software was used to register each bug, documentating screenshots, expected outcomes, real results, process and environment.
Drawio was used to create the Mental Map for the Order Form, making it much easier to identify the Interface and functionality requirements and process.
The project was organized and documentated on Excel Spreadsheets.

The Urban.Scooter application and API´s are very useful and practical, nevertheless, some adjustments can be done to better it´s quality and consequently, the users experience.
